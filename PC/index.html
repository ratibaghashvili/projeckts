                <p>Welcome to our guide on peripheral devices! These external components are essential for enhancing the performance and functionality of your computer. Whether you're working, gaming, or creating, the right peripherals can make all the difference.

                    What Are Peripheral Devices? Peripheral devices are any hardware that connects to your computer to expand its capabilities. They can be classified into three main categories:
                    
                    Input Devices: These devices allow you to send information to your computer. Key examples include:
                    
                    Keyboard – for typing text and commands.
                    Mouse – for navigating the screen and interacting with programs.
                    Scanner – for digitizing physical documents.
                    Output Devices: These devices receive information from the computer and display or deliver it. Popular output devices include:
                    
                    Monitor – for displaying visual content.
                    Printer – for creating physical copies of documents.
                    Speakers – for sound output.
                    Storage Devices: These allow you to store and transfer data externally, including:
                    
                    External Hard Drives – for large-scale storage needs.
                    USB Flash Drives – for portable and easy data transfer.</p>
